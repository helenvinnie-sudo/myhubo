Problem Statement
Current manual operation of room appliances like fans and lamps leads to inefficiency and inconvenience. 
There is a need for an automated system that can remotely monitor and control these appliances, optimizing energy use and enhancing user convenience.
Manual methods require physical presence or simple switch controls without automation or remote accessibility. 
The system should automate the appliances' operation based on environmental conditions or user commands from remote devices such as smartphones.
