Scope of the Solution
Remote control of room appliances (fan and lamp) via a wireless network.
Automatic operation triggered by sensors (e.g., motion or temperature sensors).
Use of Cisco Packet Tracer to design and simulate the system.
Integration of IoT components such as a home gateway, smart devices, and sensors.
Simulated communication between devices and remote monitoring/control interface using smartphones or PCs.
Expansion to other room appliances and sensors could be added later.
